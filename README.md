# stock-analysis

Overview of Project:

To analyze stock data by looking at total daily volume and yearly return for each stock in the list.

Results:   

The overall performance of 2017 stocks was much higher than 2018 performance.  In 2017, DQ had one of the highest returns among all the other stocks i.e approx. 199% return where as in 2018, although the total daily volume increased drastically, the return on the stock fell.  

In terms of execution times for the orignial script and the refactored script, there's big difference.  Before refactoring 2017 script took 0.632 seconds to execute where after refactoring it took 0.094 seconds.  Likewise for 2018 before refactoring it took 0.664seconds where as after refactoring it took 0.672 seconds.  

Here's the screenshot of the execution time it took before refactoring:

Here's the screenshot of the execution time it took after refactoring:

Summary: 

The advantages of refactoring code is it is much more efficient so in case of large datasets, refactoring would consume less resources.  In addition, refactored code is easier to follow so that anyone can review it.  One of the disadvantages could be if the macro involves a lot of subroutines then to refactor it can be very time consuming.
